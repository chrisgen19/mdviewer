# Organizing Your Files

Best practices for organizing your markdown documentation.

## Folder Structure

Create a logical hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── README.md
├── Getting Started/
│   ├── installation.md
│   └── quick-start.md
├── Guides/
│   ├── writing-markdown.md
│   └── organizing-files.md
└── Reference/
    └── api.md
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive file names
- Use hyphens for spaces: `quick-start.md`
- Keep names lowercase for consistency
- Use `.md` extension for all markdown files

## Tips

1. Group related documents in folders
2. Use a `README.md` in each folder as an index
3. Keep folder nesting to 2-3 levels max
4. Use clear, descriptive folder names

## Navigation

MDView will automatically:
- Display folders before files
- Sort items alphabetically
- Show folder hierarchy in the sidebar
- Track your navigation path with breadcrumbs
