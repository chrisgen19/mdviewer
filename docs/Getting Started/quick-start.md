# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with MDView in minutes!

## Step 1: Add Your Files

Simply add `.md` files to the `docs` folder:

```bash
docs/
  README.md
  Getting Started/
    installation.md
    quick-start.md
```

## Step 2: Navigate

Use the sidebar to browse your folder structure, or click through the main content area to explore files and folders.

## Step 3: Customize

- Toggle dark mode for comfortable reading
- Use breadcrumbs to quickly navigate back
- Search for files (coming soon!)

> **Tip**: Organize your markdown files in folders just like you would in any file system. MDView will automatically detect and display them.

That's it! You're ready to start viewing your markdown documentation.
